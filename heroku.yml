      You are using the beta version of this website, which is meant
      for developers only. In the interest of fast development,
      several trade-offs have been made. The data stored in this
      website may not be permanent. The database may be completely
      reset at any time. This data will also be stored off-site, using
      Heroku and Amazon Web Services. Because of these trade-offs,
      there is NO requirement that any Ellington Public Schools
      student, teacher, or other staff member use this version of the
      system. This system should be used entirely at your own risk.
