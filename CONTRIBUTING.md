# Contributing

Flexblock relies on student contributions, so we want to makle it as
easy as possible for you to contribute. Before you can contribute, you
must have a GitLab account. You can click
[here](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in) to sign up for one. You will
also need to download [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Requesting Access
If you have never contributed to Flexblock before, you will need to
request access to the repository. On the [details](/../) page for
Flexblock, you should see a button labeled `Request Access`. Press
it. After you request access, Flexblock maintainers will manually
review your request.

## Finding a Good Issue
Most of the time you contribute to Flexblock, you will be fixing an
issue. [Issues](/../issues) allow contributors to discuss problems
with the current state of the application. If you are contributing to
fix a problem you discovered yourself, you should open a new issue
about the problem. We also set aside issues that are [good for new
contributors](/../issues?label_name[]=good+first+issue). If you are
looking for something to contribute, check out these issues.

## Creating a Merge Request
After you have found an issue that no one else is working on, you
should create a merge request. A merge request is exactly what it
sounds like: a request that changes you make be merged into the
project. Go to the page of the issue you created, and click create
merge request. This will create a separate branch for you to develop
on. From the merge request page, click `Check out branch`. These
commands should be run on your local computer, in the directory
(folder) where you cloned the project. GitLab will show you what git
commands to use to clone the repository to your local machine. For
more information about using git, check out these
[resources](https://try.github.io/). After you make your changes, push
them back to GitLab. They will be automatically tested, and if they
pass the tests, they will probably be merged.
